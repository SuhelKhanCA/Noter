                    Despite the huge influence of technology in our daily life, majority of the students still create their notes manually with pen and paper. While this may work at a lower level, managing these notes becomes a tedious task at higher levels. Additionally, there is a risk of these paper notes being destroyed or lost. To resolve this problem, we decided to construct a web-based application that helps students to create and manage their notes with ease. While web-based note apps already exist and provide good services, our main aim is to increase the convenience for students manifold by building upon these apps as our base.

                    The user or the student has to first register himself in order to access the system. He can add ,remove,
                public/private his notes. He can also view the notes which are in public ledge.Each user would have a
                unique UserName and a password through which they could access their accounts. Each note created would
                have a unique id called NoteId and similarly each public note would have a PublicId.

                The admin would be provided with his/her login credentials. The admin can view different users who are
                registered on the system and would have the ability to remove them from the system. The admin can only
                view the name of the note and the user who created it , he neither can view the content of the note nor
                change it. The admin would have the facility to remove a userâ€™s note.
