        The user or the student has to first register in order to access the
        system. He can add, remove, public/private his notes. He can also view
        the notes which are in the public ledger. Each user will have a unique
        UserName and password to access their accounts. Each note created will
        have a unique ID called NoteId and similarly, each public note will have
        a PublicId.

          The admin will be provided with login credentials. The admin can view
          the list of users registered on the system and remove any user from
          the system. The admin can only view the name of the note and the user
          who created it; the admin cannot view or modify the content of the
          note. The admin also has the ability to remove a user's note.
