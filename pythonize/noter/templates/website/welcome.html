      Motivation Behind The Project

        <p>
          Despite the huge influence of technology in our daily life, the
          majority of the students still create their notes manually with pen
          and paper. While this may work at a lower level, managing these notes
          becomes a tedious task at higher levels. Additionally, there is a risk
          of these paper notes being destroyed or lost. To resolve this problem,
          we decided to construct a web-based application that helps students to
          create and manage their notes with ease. While web-based note apps
          already exist and provide good services, our main aim is to increase
          the convenience for students manifold by building upon these apps as
          our base.

        <p>
          The user or the student must first register to access the system. Once
          registered, the student can add, remove, and toggle the visibility
          (public/private) of their notes. They can also view notes available on
          the public ledger. Each user will have a unique username and password
          to access their account, and each note will have a unique identifier
          called NoteId. Similarly, each public note will have a PublicId.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Admin Controls:</strong> The admin is provided with login
          credentials and can view registered users along with their notes'
          titles and creators. However, the admin cannot view or change the
          actual note content and has the authority only to remove a user's
          note.
